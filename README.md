# Comparing the Effects of Income Level on Incarceration Rate in Cupertino and Baltimore
## Background
Considering the differences in demographics and type of city that Cupertino and Baltimore are, with Cupertino being mostly a suburb while Baltimore being more urban, it would be interesting to explore the relationship between household income levels and the incarceration rate. While I recognize before conducting the analysis that Cupertino and Baltimore are very different and the conclusions may be predictable, I believe that the visuals will be interesting to compare.
## Business Question
How might household income levels impact the incarceration rate of the next generation in Cupertino and Baltimore?
## Data Question - Open Data
I used open data from [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org).
 - the raw data directly downloaded from Opportunity Atlas is contained in all the files starting with shown_tract in the repository. Those with a -c at the end of the file name are the files for the Cupertino data, and the ones without are the files for the Baltimore data.
